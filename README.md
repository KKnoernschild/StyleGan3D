# StyleGan3D

in order to run this properly, you need to download/open the notebook named StyleGan2_3D_final.ipynb submitted on icon to Google Colab. 
you can then run cell by cell (note that since you dont have the nrrd dataset it will not run)

The python notebook allows you to mount to google drive and then clone this repository using git commands (how we were able to run this with our dataset)

More instructions and descriptions of the code are available in the colab notebook
