# StyleGan3D

https://github.com/KKnoernschild/StyleGan3D is the repository location

in order to run this properly, you need to download/open the python notebook that is in StyleGAN_project
named StyleGan2_3D.ipynb to Google Colab. you can then run cell by cell (note that since you dont have 
the nrrd dataset it won't actually run)

The python project allows you to mount to google drive (how we were able to run this with our dataset)

It also installs pynrrd.

More directions on usage are located in StyleGan2_3D.ipynb
